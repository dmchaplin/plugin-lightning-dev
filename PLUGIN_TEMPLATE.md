## Using the template

This repository provides a template for creating a plugin for the Salesforce CLI. To convert this template to a working plugin:

1. Please get in touch with the Platform CLI team. We want to help you develop your plugin.
2. Generate your plugin:

   ```
   sf plugins install dev
   sf dev generate plugin

   git init -b main
   git add . && git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
   ```

3. Create your plugin's repo in the salesforcecli github org
4. When you're ready, replace the contents of this README with the information you want.

## Learn about `sf` plugins

Salesforce CLI plugins are based on the [oclif plugin framework](https://oclif.io/docs/introduction). Read the [plugin developer guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_plugins.meta/sfdx_cli_plugins/cli_plugins_architecture_sf_cli.htm) to learn about Salesforce CLI plugin development.

This repository contains a lot of additional scripts and tools to help with general Salesforce node development and enforce coding standards. You should familiarize yourself with some of the [node developer packages](#tooling) used by Salesforce. There is also a default circleci config using the [release management orb](https://github.com/forcedotcom/npm-release-management-orb) standards.

Additionally, there are some additional tests that the Salesforce CLI will enforce if this plugin is ever bundled with the CLI. These test are included by default under the `posttest` script and it is required to keep these tests active in your plugin if you plan to have it bundled.
